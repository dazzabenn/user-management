An API for managing a list of users. This API provides methods to add, update, delete and list users. The list of users is currently only stored in memory and so will only last for as long as the web server is running the application.

Documentation can be found [here](https://glacial-spire-19827.herokuapp.com/docs/)

Some enhancements that can be made:
* Add "services" to move the business logic out of the controllers, leaving them to just orchestrate. 
* Add authentication using JSON Web Tokens
* Use an actual database to store the data, e.g. MongoDB

## Adding a user

Adds a user to the list of users. The `email` value must be unique.
